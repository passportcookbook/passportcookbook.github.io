                  <h3>Directions</h3>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350° F and put a kettle of water on to boil.</li>
                    <li>Place one pie crust in a deep-style pie pan. Prick crust with a fork several times and bake for 5-10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>In a large skillet with deep sides, sauté ground beef/lamb with onions. Season well with Lawry's, salt and pepper. Mix well to combine.</li>
                    <li>When beef loses its pink color, stir in oats and beef broth or bullion cube. Then cover mixture entirely with boiling water. Simmer mixture for 10-15 minutes until water is mostly gone. Then stir in Worcestershire Sauce, dry mustard and spices.</li>
                    <li>Spoon the mixture into the partially baked pie crust and dot the top of the filling with diced butter. Place top crust on filling, crimp sides, vent crust, and bake for 1 to 1&#188; hours. Make sure crust is slightly browned.</li>
                    <li>Let stand for five minutes before serving.</li>
                    <li>You can top with some HP sauce to add a bit of tangy goodness if you like.</li>

                      I grew up playing Trad music (Scottish/Irish/Breton music). I've played the highland bagpipes for almost 25 years and won solo and band prizes at the Scottish games throughout the southeast US.  If you've ever been to the Scottish games, you know food is a big part, and my favorite memories from going to the games over the years always involves a warm, delicious, and filling meat pie.  As a kid, a meat pie and an Irn-Bru soda always hit the spot.  As an adult, a meat pie and a brown ale or stout is just the ticket for a cool fall or winter day.

                        <p>
                          I always wanted a signature dish to make when we had gatherings pre-COVID19 whether it was for a potluck or just with friends and family. I asked my good friend who is an amazing cook to teach me how she made her green beans which are one of my favorite veggies. Her response was "Green Beans! I just throw them in a pan!" The way they taste every time I make them, makes me feel like I am the Matriarch of my family! They taste like I've been cooking for decades but the recipe is very simple.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          *small tip: In our black community it is rare that we measure ingredients out so if you feel like you put enough... just add a little more but remember you can never add enough love!

                      <p>
                        I was looking for a new recipe for St Patrick's day as it was always tradition in my house growing up to have corned beef and cabbage, however my wife Erin is not a fan of Corned Beef. So, in looking for other traditional Irish Recipes, we came across a dish called "Dublin Coddle". In researching the dish, it was found that there is really no one way to make this, it varies from house to house, but the basic potatoes, sausage, onion and parsley seemed to permeate through all varieties. Since we were both raised in North Carolina, we decided to add Greens to our variety of Coddle and we now make this each and every year at St Patrick's day with a side of Irish Soda bread and we have all of our neighbors over to share.

                                              My family and I have this recipe at Thanksgiving EVERY year. It's a twist on the classic mac and cheese. We usually double the recipe. Yes, I drew the elephant holding the mac and cheese soufleé.                                            </p>

                                            <li>Cook the couscous along with the bay leaves, cinnamon, 2 cloves of unpeeled garlic, and 1 halved onion, according to package instructions. Once cooked, remove the bay leaves, cinnamon, garlic, and onion, and set aside.</li>
                                            <li>While the couscous is steaming, make the fish stock: In a large pot, warm the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onions and smashed garlic cloves, cook until soft, about 3 minutes.</li>
                                            <li>Add the sliced almonds and peeled tomatoes, cook until the tomato starts to soften, about 3 to 5 minutes. Add water, red pepper, salt, pepper, and the shrimp heads and bodies, and bring to a boil.</li>
                                            <li>Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook until the tomatoes completely break down, about an hour. Add the remaining fish and shellfish, and simmer until cooked through, about 10 minutes.</li>
                                            <li>Transfer the fish and shellfish to a separate dish. Strain the fish stock. Pour 3 tablespoons of fish stock over the couscous and let sit, covered, for one hour before serving.</li>
                                            <li>Serve the couscous topped with the cooked fish, garnished with chopped parsley and lemon, and with the strained fish stock on the side (for pouring over the entire dish, as desired).</li>

                                              My family comes from a long line of deep Sicilian roots on my mother's side (photo of great-grandma Caito attached). This recipe reminds me of my ancestral homeland and embodies what I grew up hearing about traditional cuisine on the Sicilian coast. Growing up, we also incorporated a lot of seafood and couscous into our meals, which are just a few Sicilian staples.

                                            <li>&#8531; cup oil (vegetable/canola/coconut, not olive oil)</li>

                                            <li>3 tbsp tomato paste</li>
                                            <li>2 tsp (Carribean/Jamaican-style) curry powder</li>
                                            <li>1 tsp dried thyme</li>
                                            <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
                                            <li>5 to 6 cups stock (vegetable, chicken, or beef), or water, divided</li>
                                            <li>2 tsp unsalted butter (optional), divided</li>

                                          <h3>Directions</h3>
                                          <ol>
                                            <li>In a blender, combine tomatoes, red poblano (or bell) peppers, chopped onions, and Scotch bonnets with 2 cups of stock, blend till smooth, about a minute or two. You should have roughly 6 cups of blended mix. Pour into a large pot/ pan and bring to the boil then turn down and let simmer, covered for 10 - 12 minutes</li>
                                            <li>In a large pan, heat oil and add the sliced onions. Season with a pinch of salt, stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, then add the bay leaves, curry powder and dried thyme and a pinch of black pepper for 3 - 4 minutes on medium heat. Then add the tomato paste - stir for another 2 minutes. Add the reduced tomato-pepper-Scotch bonnet mixture, stir, and set on medium heat for 10 to 12 minutes till reduced by half, with the lid on. This is the stew that will define the pot.</li>
                                            <li>Add 4 cups of the stock to the cooked tomato sauce and bring it to boil for 1 - 2 minutes.</li>
                                            <li>Add the rinsed rice and butter, stir, cover with a double piece of foil/baking or parchment paper and put a lid on the pan—this will seal in the steam and lock in the flavour. Turn down the heat and cook on low for 30 minutes.</li>
                                            <li>Stir rice—taste and adjust as required.</li>
                                            <li>If you like, add sliced onions, fresh tomatoes and the 2nd teaspoon of butter and stir through.</li>
                                            <li>To make Party Rice, you'll need one more step. Now Party Rice is essentially Smoky Jollof Rice, traditionally cooked over an open fire. However, you can achieve the same results on the stove top. Here's how: Once the rice is cooked, turn up the heat with the lid on and leave to "burn" for 3 to 5 minutes. You'll hear the rice crackle and snap and it will smell toasted. Turn off the heat and leave with the lid on to "rest" till ready to serve. The longer the lid stays on, the smokier. Let the party begin!</li>

                                              Of the rice dishes in Nigeria, Jollof rice is my favorite because it was cooked on special occasions only. It takes top skills and many ingredients to cook a delicious Jollof rice! Rather than documenting recipes,  in Nigeria, recipes were passed down orally from one generation to the next. Hence, as common as Jollof rice is, no two Jollof rice dishes tasted the same which made the dish more special, mysterious and unique. Since I was a kid, I've always enjoyed a good Jollof rice meal, with chicken, coleslaw, and fried ripe plantain. The attached recipe is similar to the one I use currently.

                                <li>Next sprinkle the salt and tumeric.</li>
                                <li>If using rolled oats, then pour 1 cup water. Or if using quick oats, use &#189; cup water.</li>
                                <li>Mix well and then taste the water. The water has to be slightly salty. If needed, add more salt. Bring it to a boil.</li>
                                <li>Transfer the roasted oats and give a gentle mix to incorporate the water with the oats.</li>
                                <li>Within 1 to 2 minutes the water will be absorbed. Cover and cook on a low flame for 2 minutes or until alt the moisture is evaporated.</li>
                                <li>Add chopped coriander leaves. Mix well.</li>
                                <li>When the temperature comes down, pour 1 tbsp lemon juic. You can top it with some fresh grated coconut if you have. It tastes good as is.</li>
                                <li>Oats upma is best served with yogurt.</li>

                                Upma is a South Indian dish typically made with semolina (semolina flour is used for pasta). My family recently started putting an american spin on the traditional dish by substituting the semolina with oats. The dish will have a savory and spices forward flavor. Definitely worth the try if you want to mix up your regular breakfast routine.

                                This recipe is not for the faint of heart but it is dear to mine. My mother is from a small town outside Vijayawada, arguably the birthplace of this amazing dish: Andhra Chicken Curry or "Andhra Kodi Kura". The number of ingredients may seem alarming but it's an easy dish to cook nonetheless...although I must warn you...the dish does pack a punch.

Roll a section of the dough into a large square to about a 1/8" thick, adding flour as needed. Cut dough into 2"x2" squares and remove any scrap dough and place it back in the bowl to re-roll.</li>
                                <li>Gently picking up a dough square, use a spoon to place about a tablespoon of mashed potatoes in the center, fold the square in half and pinch the edges to seal. If the dough is not sealing, you can wet your fingers and run it along the edges to melt the seam. Set aside and repeat with the rest of the precut squares.</li>
                                <li>Once you have completed all the perogies, gently drop them into the boiling water and allow them to cook until they float (1-2 min). Use a slotted spoon to remove the perogies and place in a strainer, allowing your water to continue to simmer for the next batch.</li>
                                <li>Roll out the next quarter or dough and repeat as above. Once you place that batch into the pot to cook, you can move your previous batch from the strainer to a large bowl, cover with about 1/4 of the browned butter and stir. Repeat these steps until you have used all the dough or mashed potatoes.</li>
                                <li>Perogies are traditionally served with cooked onions and sour cream.</li>
                                <li>Perogies will keep for about 1 week and can be frozen. I prefer to heat mine in a skillet to make them crispy.You can experiment with different flavors of mashed potatoes and fillings.</li>

                                This recipe is one I learned because my Grammy (mom's mom) was Polish. She never carried any traditions from her family down because they were ashamed of their heritage once they came to America. My Grammy was an amazing cook and every time I make these, it is in her honor.
